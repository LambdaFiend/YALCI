# Simply Typed Lambda Calculus Extended
Haskell implementation of the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus with a variety of extensions, type checking and inference (algorithm T, as of yet).

The steps for setting up this project are as follows:

```cabal build```

```cabal run```

If any warning appears, fix it! If you need to install a missing dependency, it can be accomplished by using a command such like:

```cabal install --lib <library_name>```

It's very likely to be a missing dependency (the issue), so this should suffice.

**You need cabal in order to use this, as you may have already noticed.**
